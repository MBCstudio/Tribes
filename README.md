# Tribal Simulation

This project simulates a dynamic battle between five distinct tribes with unique attributes and behaviors. The simulation uses pseudorandom movement and combat mechanics to create an engaging and unpredictable experience.

## Features

- **Five Tribes**:
  - **Yellow**, **White**, **Purple**, **Black**, and **Green** tribes.
  - Each tribe has unique attribute distributions, ensuring diverse strategies and outcomes.
- **Randomized Movement**:
  - Units move across the map based on pseudorandom vectors.
  - Possible battles are triggered when units converge on the same position.
- **Combat System**:
  - Outcomes are determined by randomly selected attributes (e.g., strength, IQ, agility, endurance).
  - Multi-unit battles resolve iteratively until only one tribe prevails on the contested tile.
- **Customizable Inputs**:
  - Configure the number of settlers for each tribe.
  - Adjust map size to fit different simulation scales.
